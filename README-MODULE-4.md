This is a completion of the assignment which contains Python program for the Module 4, covering two separate tasks.

Task 1: Calculate Factorial Using a Function

File: Task-1- Module 4.py

Description :- 
--> The task was to perform a python program in which we have to create a function named factorial that takes a number as argument and calculates the factorial using a loop or recursion (I have used loop in this program). Then after returns that calculated factorial and calls the function with sample number.

--> As per the knowledge of Module 4, I have perform this program with the help of user-defined  function factorial, variable n, result a1 and i, conditional statement like if, return statement, for loop and at last print() function. I have also you the format() function of string formatting from Module-6 Lecture-11, which here was necessary for achieving the expected output given in the assignment.


Task 2: Using the math module for calculations.

File: Task-2- Module 4.py

Description :-
--> The task was to perform a python program which uses the math module to calculate the square root, natural logarithm and sine of the number and then display there result.

--> I have performed this program with the help of a1 variable, input() function, import math(import for importing the module and math is the module), print() function and inside math.sqrt(a1),
math.log(a1) and math.sin(a1) are used to calculate and display the expected result.
