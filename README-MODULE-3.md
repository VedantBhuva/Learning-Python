This is a completion of the assignment which contains Python program for the Module 3, covering two separate tasks.

Task 1: Check if the number is Even or Odd

File: Task-1- Module 3.py

Description :- 
--> The task was to perform a python program which takes the input numbers from the user and from that it checks whether the number is Even or Odd. I have done this program using conditional statements.

--> As per the knowledge of Module 3, I have perform this program with the help of int() function, input() function, print() function, necessary arithmetic and comparison operators like %, ==. The main thing which makes the program to live is conditional statement. I have use conditional statement like if and else. At last, I have use 1 variable in which the tasks are performed.


Task 2: Sum of Integer from 1 to 50 using a loop

File: Task-2- Module 3.py

Description :-
--> The task was to perform a python program which is used to perform sum of 1 to 50 number using a loop. I have used for loop to perform the program.

--> I have performed this program with the help of 2 variables, one for sum and another to run in the loop's iteration. For loop that uses a variable for iteration, arithmetic operator to add the value of i variable used for iteration of number, in T variable which is given the value 0 so every iteration add the value in T variable, and print it with the print() function.
